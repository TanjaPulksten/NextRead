# NextRead
This is a project for mobile programming course. 

I chose to build an app for avid readers to find new interesting books and a place to store a wish list of them. The app also has a map function to locate nearest bookstores. 

I first planned the app and it's functions in writing and then made a clickable prototype of it with Axure RP. The proto can be found at https://4eozz1.axshare.com/

Naturally the end result is not an exact copy of the prototype, but all the functions I planned can be found in the app. The app is not published in appstores.

Next steps to further develop this app would be to add a list for books already read and opportunity to rate them. And then it would be great to have recommendations based on read books with good ratings. 

Here are some screenshots and explanations from the end result.
